                    <em>Enlist</em> is a collage work constructed from photos taken around the USC campus. My goal was
                    to utilize the environmental textures from the photographs to create an aged, dystopian aura about
                    the piece. Layering and a restricted pallet work together to highlight these textures.

                    <em>Gray's Assembly</em> was created in response to the prompt of "organic cyborg." It is another
                    collage work.  My goal with the piece was to subvert the traditional concept of a cyborg.  The title
                    suggests a complete cycle between organic and artificial life where artificial life begins to enhance itself with organic components.

                    This work is an editorial design project which traces my base motivations in life.  From robotics
                    to space travel, the concepts of creating and discovering the unknown drive me to succeed.  My goal
                    was to highlight elements from various areas about which I am passionate in order to create a multi-
                    page, cohesive viewing experience.
