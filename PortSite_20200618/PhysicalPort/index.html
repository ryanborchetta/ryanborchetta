        <h2>Formula SAE Uprights</h2>
        <p>
            This is a showcase of my Fall 2019 design project for the USC Racing's 2020 Formula SAE car.  I was tasked with
            redesigning the uprights, which are the components that link the wheel package and breaks to the suspension.
            The uprights are a critical component that have to be engineered to exact specifications while minimizing
            weight. The uprights for the 2020 car required a major redesign in order to accommodate a new 10" wheel package (down from
            13" previously).

                    Seen here are the front (top) and rear (bottom) 2019 components.  They had to be completely redesigned in order to accommodate the
                    much smaller wheel package. This provided numerous opportunities to optimize the design in order to
                    shave off precious weight.  A direct translation of this design to a smaller package was put through
                    finite element analysis (FEA), which revealed it was overbuilt for our expected load case.

                    These were the first iteration of a more streamlined design concept.  They were approximately 25%
                    lighter than the original design concept.  These early versions were used to validate the fundamental
                    design concepts under estimated loading scenario.

                    These are the final designs for the uprights.  These versions integrated the calculate suspension
                    mounting points as well as additional weight saving measures.  They are approximately 40% lighter
                    than the old design concept, and significantly less than half the weight of the 2019 components.
                    Also shown are some of the FEA simulations that were used to validate the designs.
